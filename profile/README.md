# Prognostika - S.M.A.R.T Disk Array Failure Prediction System 🚀

## Overview

Since the 1990s, the value of data has been recognized as surpassing that of the hard drives it is stored on. There has been a persistent need for technology that can predict hard drive failures and provide relatively safe data protection. Current industry practices use threshold judgment methods to analyze S.M.A.R.T (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) data of well-functioning disks. However, these methods often suffer from low accuracy, unclear real disk conditions, and insufficient emphasis on potential failures.

In response to the growing demand for portable data sets and expectations for data security and stability, our organization has developed the S.M.A.R.T Disk Array Failure Prediction System. This system leverages genetic algorithms, Temporal Convolutional Network (ECN) and transfer learning to enhance the prediction of disk failures.

## Key Features 🔑

- **Advanced Monitoring** 📊: Monitors various hard disk attributes such as data throughput performance, and motor startup time, and seeks error rate against standard values.
- **Weighted Impact Analysis** ⚖️: Sets different weights according to the impact of each attribute, addressing the issue of data imbalance.
- **Feature Selection with Genetic Algorithm** 🧬: Utilizes Genetic Algorithm to automatically select the most relevant features for prediction based on the recent period.
- **Advanced AI Algorithms** 🧠: Utilizes TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network) for incremental iterative training.
- **Transfer Learning** 🔄: Adapts the model across different disk models from the same manufacturer, reducing the number of models that need to be trained while ensuring high predictive accuracy.

## Benefits 🎉

- **Enhanced Prediction Accuracy** 🎯: Provides finer predictions of disk lifespan and potential failures.
- **Adaptability** 🛠️: Generalizes across various models, significantly broadening the usability of the system.
- **Data Security** 🔒: Enhances the safety and stability of data storage.

## Applications 📲

The S.M.A.R.T Disk Array Failure Prediction System has a wide range of applications, from corporate data centers to individual users who value data integrity. Its ability to predict failures before they occur helps in proactive data management and reduces the risk of data loss.
